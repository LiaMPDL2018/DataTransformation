Different architectural topologies have been generated by adjusting the N-donor ligands. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex 1 shows a rare 1D [rightward arrow] 2D polyrotaxane network. Complex 2 possesses an unprecedented 2-nodal (3{,}10)-connected 3D framework with a Schlafli symbol of (43)2(46[middle dot]632[middle dot]83)(43)2. When the 2-connected points (H3L and 1{,}3-bitl ligands) are not calculated{,} complex 3 shows a hcb uninodal 3-connected 2D network with the Schlafli symbol (63){,} which further constructs a 3D supramolecular structure through O-H[three dots{,} centered]O hydrogen bonds; while the 2-connected points are taken into account{,} complex 3 exhibits an unprecedented 3-nodal (2{,}2{,}4)-connected network. Complex 4 presents an unprecedented 2-nodal (3{,}5)-connected 3D framework with a (4[middle dot]62)(4[middle dot]66[middle dot]83) topology{,} while complex 5 exhibits another unprecedented 2-nodal (3{,}5)-connected 2D framework with a (42[middle dot]67[middle dot]8)(42[middle dot]6) Schlafli symbol and shows 2D [rightward arrow] 3D supramolecular structure through O-H[three dots{,} centered]O hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile{,} the magnetic properties of complexes 2 and 4 are discussed. Moreover{,} the dye adsorption and mechanism studies indicate that the pore size{,} the uncoordinated O atoms in carboxyl groups and the uncoordinated carboxyl groups of the MOFs have significant effects on the dye adsorption capacity."
