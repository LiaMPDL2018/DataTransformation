Different architectural topologies have been generated by adjusting the N-donor ligands. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that complex  shows a rare 1D \u2192 2D polyrotaxane network. Complex  possesses an unprecedented 2-nodal (3,10)-connected 3D framework with a Schl\u00e4fli symbol of (4)(4\u00b76\u00b78)(4). When the 2-connected points (HL and 1,3-bitl ligands) are not calculated, complex  shows a  uninodal 3-connected 2D network with the Schl\u00e4fli symbol (6), which further constructs a 3D supramolecular structure through O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonds; while the 2-connected points are taken into account, complex  exhibits an unprecedented 3-nodal (2,2,4)-connected network. Complex  presents an unprecedented 2-nodal (3,5)-connected 3D framework with a (4\u00b76)(4\u00b76\u00b78) topology, while complex  exhibits another unprecedented 2-nodal (3,5)-connected 2D framework with a (4\u00b76\u00b78)(4\u00b76) Schl\u00e4fli symbol and shows 2D \u2192 3D supramolecular structure through O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, the magnetic properties of complexes  and  are discussed. Moreover, the dye adsorption and mechanism studies indicate that the pore size, the uncoordinated O atoms in carboxyl groups and the uncoordinated carboxyl groups of the MOFs have significant effects on the dye adsorption capacity."
