IrO remains one of the most important catalysts for water oxidation reaction. Dimensionally stable anodes (DSA) are composed of primarily IrO. These materials require being treated through activation protocols before they can be implemented. IrO materials were shown to be very active by Mallouk  In the alkaline media, Mallouk  proposed that these materials are unstable and form molecular species that show oxygen activity. In fact, the activity shown by these materials in alkaline electrolytes was much higher than in acidic or neutral electrolytes. We have recently characterized the active IrO material through  Raman spectroscopy on anodic IrO grown on an iridium foil. Attempts to understand the mechanism of OER on IrO has encouraged operando studies using XPS and XAS. These investigations focused on an Ir-centered approach to understanding the nature of the active catalyst. XPS studies observed an additional Ir 4f peak at higher binding energy (+0.7 eV) during OER and suggested an Ir species forming during the catalytic event. Minguzzi  suggested the formation of both Ir and Ir during OER. But both these studies do not compare the shifts to standard Ir-containing compounds. High oxidation states (+5 or greater) are only known for fluorine-containing molecules amongst the stable Ir compounds or in IrO molecular species isolated within a noble gas matrix. Reier  and Pfeiffer  observed an additional feature at 529 eV in the O-Kedge NEXAFS spectra of highly OER active Ir\u2013NiO and amorphous IrO respectively. Using DFT calculations, they have suggested this to be an electrophilic oxygen species present in these materials. By the nature of their inquiry, these studies cannot clarify the exact chemical nature of the IrO active site which is possible through vibrational spectroscopy. Mo  carried out  Raman spectroscopy on IrO/Au system but essentially used XAS data for interpretation of results. Frei and coworkers have investigated IrO clusters as OER catalysts using rapid scan FTIR under visible light. They reported detection of a transient Ir\u2013OOH species with O\u2013O vibration being detected at 830 cm. This work goes beyond work reported by Pavlovic  and uses  Raman spectroscopy to understand the behavior of these materials under conditions of OER. Specifically we focus on active site that forms . We suggest a Ir\ue001O species, with five coordinated square pyramidal Ir as the active site for water oxidation and suggest a mechanistic pathway for product formation and replenishment of the active site."

The peaks from 450\u2013780 cm originate from iridium oxygen vibrations, where peak assignments have been used from Pavlovic  Electrochemically, four regions (R) in the IrO CV can be clearly identified. R1( < 0.4 V), R2 (0.4 <  < 0.7 V), R3 (0.7 <  < 1.2 V) and R4 ( < 1.4 V). Whereas R1 corresponds to a colorless compound rich in Ir, R2 represents the region of first oxidation wave from Ir\u2194 Ir. At the beginning of the experiment at OCP, there is a certain peak structure (465, 527, 600, 702 cm), which can be attributed to the Ir\u2013O\u2013Ir stretch vibrations of \u03bc-oxo type from the basal plane of edge sharing IrO octahedra. As soon as the potential of 0.4 V is applied, a sharp peak at 520 cm is formed. This is the most dominant peak  in region R1. Region R1 has no \u03b5 peak which appears in R2. The \u03b5 peak loses intensity in R3. R4 shows significant drift of peaks \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b5 towards higher frequencies. At potentials 1.3 V and higher, AuO is formed (Fig. S4, ESI). Thus peaks in R4 have substantial AuO contribution to them. The final peaks observed at OCP in the treated materials are composed of both IrO and AuO peaks. The peak \u03b7 at 771 cm is seen in R4. This peak disappears as soon as the applied potential is switched off. This peak does not exist in experiments done on a bare Au surface and thus must be assigned to IrO material under conditions of water oxidation. Isotopic substitution using DO and HO as synthesis and reaction media were also carried out. Results have been tabulated in .  shows effects of isotopic substitution on \u03b7. In the experiment that has 50\u2009:\u200950 (HO\u2009:\u2009HO), only two peaks of nearly equal intensity were visible. Thus this peak could be assigned to Ir\ue001O vibration (as opposed to any other species that contained O\u2013O, or OH vibration). If O movement is the primary oscillator in this vibration, then one can expect a shift of  upon O substitution. Deuterium substitution resulted in almost no shift of the peak (\u0394 \u223c 5 cm). For Ir\u2013O\u2013OH containing groups, the shift reported by Frei  due to deuteration was 30 cm. Small shifts due to deuteration are possible through altered hydrogen bonding contributions from the solvent. Vibrations where the motion of the hydrogen atom explicitly contribute to the vibrational mode show significant alteration of frequency upon deuteration due to the large mass change . Fig. S5 (ESI) shows the results from various experiments with combinations of HO, DO, and HO containing electrolytes. , shows \u03b7 peak at OER potentials in variously labeled electrolytes. Fig. S5(d) (ESI) shows the results of experiments when material was synthesized in HO and tested in HO. Peaks \u03b3 to \u03b5 begin to split into two sets of peaks in the beginning of R3 indicating that material exchanges oxygens with the electrolyte even at potentials as low as 0.7 V. Even the position of \u03b7 peak only shows the contribution from O isotope."

Specifically, calculations were performed to understand the identity of the Ir\ue001O species. A trimeric IrO unit was used to construct a model system for calculation. It was found that an Ir\u2013O unit on the central Ir atom resulted in the formation of a square pyramidal central Ir atom. [Ir\u2013Ir\u2013Ir] trimeric IrO cluster was used for computation (). The Ir\u2013O vibration was computed to be at 829 cm. Furthermore it was found that the vibrations could be significantly modulated through hydrogen bonding near the \u201cIr\u2013O\u201d  the Ir\u2013O vibration was reduced to 766 cm from 829 cm by placing a HO molecule near the Ir\u2013O moiety. Besides, the relative intensity of this vibration was found to be very strong compared to the other vibrations within this molecule. We believe at the optimum potential some of the [IrO] species turn into the OER active Ir\ue001O species that removes any further oxidative strain from the material. Even though present in much less quantity, the extremely high Raman activity of the Ir\u2013O stretch vibration makes it possible for the active species to be detected within a matrix of [IrO] containing material. The 771 cm peak can also be detected in acidic media but has a much smaller intensity (the OER activity of the material in acidic and neutral media is much less than alkaline media (Fig. S2, ESI)). This is likely because the material is highly condensed in the acidic and neutral media and not many exposed active sites containing Ir\ue001O species form, which gets reflected in the overall activity of the material. Ir\u2013OOH species (Fig. S7, ESI) were also computed. The frequency of vibration of O\u2013O stretch was 715 cm, besides the O\u2013O stretch Raman intensity was much smaller. In light of our experimental and computational investigations we assign the observed 771 cm vibration to Ir\ue001O stretch of a square pyramidal Ir site. The frontier orbitals of IrO were calculated and have been visualized in . The SOMO () shows that Ir\u2013O unit is the most reactive part of the molecule with a major part of the molecular orbital localised in this region. The frontier orbitals are anti-bonding in nature between Ir-d and O-p with significant localization on O atom making it a suitable target for reaction. We believe this oxygen may be responsible for making the important O\u2013O bond during the formation of molecular O from water (). M\u2013O species responsible for oxidizing water are common in literature. In case of Mn-containing Photosystem II catalyst, the O\u2013O bond formation either happens through a nucleophilic attack at the Mn\u2013O center (Mn\u2013O, Mn\u2013O or Mn\u2013oxyl) species or by an oxyl\u2013oxyl radical coupling mechanism. But the exact nature of the species is debatable. It has been suggested in the literature that an electrophilic oxygen at the active site is essential to make reactions like O\u2013O bond formation and C\u2013H bond activation, possible. Wang  and Concepcion and coworkers suggested an O\u2013O bond formation using nucleophilic attack on Ru\ue001O site. Using DFT based theory, Mai  suggested that C\u2013H activation essentially consists of two parts, an Fe\ue001O species which was a precursor to Fe\u2013O\u02d9 oxyl species that carried out the hydrogen atom transfer. Similarly, using DFT calculations Yang  have argued that Ru\ue001O can act as a precursor to Ru\u2013O\u02d9 oxyl species which carries out water O\u2013O bond formation. For the IrO cluster shown in , the total L\u00f6wdin charge at the oxygen atom amounts to only \u22120.12 (as compared to \u22120.35 for the bridging oxo-s) and the L\u00f6wdin spin population at the central Ir and oxo amounts to 47% and 29%, respectively. Semantically, although this charge distribution would be compatible with a metal-oxyl (O\u02d9) species, the spin distribution rather indicates a much lower spin population at the oxygen (29%) than expected for a radical species (\u223c100%). This is the result of a somewhat covalent Ir\u2013O \u03c0-interaction that involves the spin carrying d orbital (t in octahedral symmetry) at Ir (ESI). We believe what we see in our experiment, is the structure that is precursor to the reactive oxyl species as proposed by Mai and Yang  The observation of a reactive oxyl radical species under experimental conditions remains difficult, specifically at room temperature. Herlihy  observed an oxyl species on TiO system using  ultrafast infrared spectroscopy. Based on our data, we claim an Ir\u2013O species that can in principle act as a precursor to a highly electrophilic oxyl species that reacts with water (or dissociated water) to form an O\u2013O bond."

Whereas the colour and vibrational spectroscopy of most of this material can be traced using  spectroscopy, the formation of an active a square pyramidal \u201cIr\u2013O\u201d species is detectable only through  spectroscopy under applied potential. We propose that this Ir\u2013O species is the active site within the molecule which is open to attack from HO molecules leading to formation of O through formation of an O\u2013O bond as shown in . The OER chemistry is likely to proceed primarily in the ligand sphere."
